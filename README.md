## Introduction 

LACChain Wiki lists and describes the LACChain network Git repositories. All the repositories of the LACChain Alliance are licensed with Apache license version 2.0.

## Repository guide 

The following section describes the LACChain Git repositories and their corresponding layers in the LACChain ecosystem.  

The different layers of the LACChain ecosystem are: 

**LACChain DLT:** public-permissioned networks, open, decentralized, multipurpose, multi-community, scalable, regulated, with identification, and transaction fee free. 

**LACChain ID:** self-sovereign identity, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), verifiable presentations, digital wallets, CAs, trust lists, regulation, data protection, trust frameworks.  

**LACChain TFM:** tokenized fiat money, minted by authorized financial institutions, regulatory compliant. KYC and AML process. E-money token standard.  

The layers are built as the figure describes:

Description: this repository contains the verifiable credentials, smart contracts, and ansible playbooks for node deployment for the LACChain DAVID-19PActÂ® network. The DAVID-19PActÂ® is a task force where different LACChain partners collaborate to lead a campaign to provide useful blockchain-based solutions to combat the spread of the Coronavirus. The goal is to:

* Propose a standard for the forms and the verifiable credentials that are generated by different digital wallets to notarize information about isolation periods, symptoms, infection, and recovery.

* Create a single smart contract that will register all the cryptographic proofs of the credentials so every app whitelisted can register the proofs on it, and everyone can verify them against it. The smart contract also records the anonymous data in a decentralize way, so no central back-end/server is necessary.

* Provide a map where pseudonymous information about citizens is displayed with different colors depending on if they are healthy (blue), with symptoms (yellow), affected (red), or recovered (green). Additionally, dashboards will show total numbers of engagement and other useful information. The only information that is collected is age, sex, location, and information to notarize.

**David19 API** **-** [**https://github.com/lacchain/david19-api-nodejs**](https://github.com/lacchain/david19-api-nodejs)

Description: this repository contains the source code and docker container images for the API that serves the map within the DAVID-19PActÂ®, providing pseudonymous information about citizens health and dashboard.

**Credential service** **-** [**https://github.com/lacchain/credential-server**](https://github.com/lacchain/credential-server)

Description: this repository contains the source code and the docker container images for the Credential Provider Server that can generate, sign, validate, update, and revoke credentials. The credentials follow the standard Verifiable Credentials (VC) by the W3C. Credentials can be used to contain information about anything. Also, they can be signed by the issuer, and refer to a subject. Therefore, if the issuer is trusted by a third party, this third party can trust information about the subject by verifying the validity of the credential, without having to ask the issuer. When the previous is leveraged, and the subject is in control of their credentials, we can build identity models that fall into the category of self-sovereign identity (SSI).

**Academy Credential Issuance** **-** [**https://github.com/lacchain/academy-vc**](https://github.com/lacchain/academy-vc)

Description: 
LACChain VC is a Proof-Of-Concept application that allow issuance and on-chain verification of Verifiable Credentials (VC) following the W3C data model, EIP-712 and EIP-1812 for credential signatures and on-chain claims verification respectively.

**Hashing service** **-** [**https://github.com/lacchain/hashing-service**](https://github.com/lacchain/hashing-service)

Description: this repository contains the source code for the LACChain Hashing service that can hash any type of file, from applications to documents and media. Hashing a file results in a unique and irreversible identifier. If this identifier is registered in an immutable network, as a blockchain ledger, the owner of the file can prove at any time afterwards that the file was not modified. This hashing service signs the hash to guarantee that the file was hashed by itself and sends it to https://github.com/lacchain/credential-server to write it down in the LACChain blockchain network.
